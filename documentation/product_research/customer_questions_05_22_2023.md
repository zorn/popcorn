# Customer Questions for May 22, 2023

In the book [The Mom Test][1] it recommends pre-planing the three important questions for each customer segment. You want to do this so you make sure you are asking important questions and not the types of question which lead to bad data or inflated egos.

Aside: Eventually some of these questions should lead toward commitment and advancement but in the current scope of Popcorn we don't have much to commit to. We are just trying to learn about the problem space of conference video archives.

## Segment: Conference Video Consumers

People who watch conference videos in order to learn about or skill up in a technology or process.

**Assumptions**

* People consider conference videos to be of high educational value.
* Being a usually free or low cost purchase helps availability.
* People consume 3-5 conference videos a year, mostly when they are targeting a specific skill up, though some out of curiosity.
* Most people are watching videos on YouTube or a private website.
* Most people agree they should watch more but do not.
* People discover conference videos through a mix of manual archive browsing for conference they are aware of and peer recommendations.
* If a person actively wanted to learn about a topic and find a conference talk they would search YouTube or Google/DDG to find it.
* There was a pain at some point trying to go back to a previously consumed video and find a specific point of topic/slide. (This pain is one that would be solved by the improved searching I have in mind. It would be good to verify people would use it.)

**Questions**

* When was the last time you identified a work skill you wanted to level up?
* What was that skill and how did you seek to improve yourself? (Trying to learn about what forms of media they use and why.)
* What about that medium worked best for you?
* Do you ever watch conference video recordings? How often? Can you name the last three you watched?
* How did you watch them (via YouTube? at your desk? Laptop? iPad?)?
* How do you find which videos to watch?
* Have you ever paid for access to a conference video archive? 
* Did you ever go back to re-watch a video? If so, why? (Trying to learn if having more intelligent timestamps/markers would help them find the info they are looking for.)

**Value**

* Let people search within a conference video collection.
* Let people search within a speaker's collection.
* Provide metadata like slide links alongside video.
* Provide an AI summary of the talk.
* Provide timestamped comments
* Use AI to extract links and other text from the presentation (listed as timestamp comments)
* 🤷‍♂️ Enable group/watch-party like features.

## Segment: Conference Video Presenters

**Assumptions**

* People who do conference presentations are motivated by trying to be a positive influence in their community, to help gain exposure for better work/networking.
* Most speakers do not keep an up-to-date archive of their talks/slides/etc.
* Most speakers do not go back and promote their past talks very much but would welcome the behavior (getting more people to see their hard work).

**Questions**

* Why do you do conference talks?
* Do you have a personal website with all of your talks listed/linked?
* Do you know off hand how many saw the presentation live vs the recorded version? 
* Do you ever keep up with the comments on your talk videos? (trying to gauge their awareness of their video consumption/comments).

**Value**

* Create an good index of talks experience per speaker, so that they might link to it to show off their work.
* Let people follow individual speakers (in-app and via RSS) so they can be alerted when new cross-conference talks are available
* Helps speakers get promotion of their work by generating clips for social posts with tags.

## Segment: Conference Organizers

**Assumptions**

* Conference organizers struggle with publishing the talks to the public vs the value they provide to event attendees.
* Most publish to YouTube without a lot of extra promotion outside of notifying the past attendees.
* The video archive is not high on their pain/concern list but they recognize the value of these assets.

**Questions**

* Do you record and publish talks? 
* Do you ever make the recordings available to attendees first before the public? How do you do that?
* How much work is involved in capturing and publishing a good recording?
* Are there any other notable pains about the video archive process?
* Do you ever use the past year's archive to promote the upcoming year's event?

**Value**

* Promotion of their past and future events.
* Maybe give them a hook to blend in their event sponsors into the page presentation (for a small fee?)
* 🤷‍♂️ Service to help produce the archive from raw footage?
* 🤷‍♂️ Maybe provide them a space to upload videos prior to YouTube for authenticated access and then give them publish buttons to YouTube to ease the deployment.

# Notes

## The Mom Test

> 1. Talk about their life instead of your idea 
> 2. Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future 
> 3. Talk less and listen more

## Good Questions

Every time you talk to someone, you should be asking at least one question which has the potential to destroy your currently imagined business.

"Does this problem matter" questions.
